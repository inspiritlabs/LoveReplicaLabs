1. Messages Counter Fix
You do not know the exact part of the code that manages the counter, but find where the application adds or subtracts from the counter for each message. 
Stack Overflow

Identify any statement where the logic subtracts one from the counter when a new message arrives or is sent. 
Stack Overflow

Remove any decrement operation so that the counter is never reduced; instead, every time a user sends or receives a message, only increase the counter by one. 
Stack Overflow

Ensure that the initial value starts at zero or reflects any persisted value and that only increments occur after each message.

2. Remove “CREATE your Replica” Heading
You do not know the exact file names or components, but look for the literal text “CREATE your Replica” on both the loading page and the form page. 
Stack Overflow

Delete the entire text “CREATE your Replica” so that nothing replaces it and nothing else is moved or restyled. 
Stack Overflow

After removing it, confirm there is no blank space or extra container left behind—simply the heading text should be gone, but all other UI elements remain exactly where they are.

3. Cap Voice-Slot Limit to Five
You do not know the back-end code, but locate where the application checks the number of existing custom voices a user has. 
Medium

Change the maximum allowed number from ten (or any current value) to exactly five so that when a user already has five voices, attempts to create another one immediately produce an error. 
Medium

Ensure that the error text reads exactly “VOICE LIMIT REACHED (5)” and that no new UI components are introduced. 
Medium

Do not alter any other logic or elements—just enforce that the count cannot exceed five.

4. Auto-Launch Immersive Fullscreen Chat
You do not know which function opens the chat, but find where the application transitions into the immersive chat view. 
Aha!

Remove any requirement for the user to click an “Enter Chat” button; trigger the chat-opening logic immediately when the user finishes with the previous screen or arrives at the chat route. 
Aha!

Ensure that as soon as the chat is displayed, it requests fullscreen mode so that it occupies the entire browser viewport. 
Aha!

Keep all existing UI elements unchanged except for forcing the chat container into fullscreen—no new buttons or links.

5. Add Message Counter in Immersive Chat
You do not know where the immersive chat UI is defined, but find the area where messages are rendered and add a small numeric display showing the total number of messages. 
Stack Overflow

This counter should be a single number with no border, background, or additional styling beyond default text color, located inside the chat view. 
Stack Overflow

Ensure it updates in real time, matching the counter from Section 1 so that after each new message, the number increments by one. 
Stack Overflow

Do not introduce any borders, backgrounds, or additional UI elements—just the numeric text. 
Stack Overflow

6. Verify No Other UI or Flow Changes
Double-check that no buttons, margins, colors, or element structures have been altered. 
Reddit

Confirm that removing the heading did not leave empty wrappers or unused containers in the loading page or form page. 
Stack Overflow

Ensure that limiting the voice count to five does not surface any additional warnings or modals besides the specified error message. 
Medium

Verify that making the chat fullscreen and auto-launching it does not hide or break any part of the existing interface—everything beyond requesting fullscreen remains identical.
